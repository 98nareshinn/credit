### Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

[Send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=Today&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### The app does not show up in the menu bar

macOS hides menu bar apps when there is no space left in the menu bar. This is a common problem on MacBooks with a notch. Try quitting some menu bar apps to free up space. If this does not solve it, try quitting Bartender if you have it installed.

#### Can the app show notifications for events? {#notifications}

You can set up notifications for events in the Calendar app.

#### Can you add color to events to indicate their calendar?

This app is a personal experiment to make the simplest calendar app possible. Ask yourself, do you really need these colors or is it just clutter? I'm happy to [discuss](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=Today&referrer=Website-FAQ). Maybe I'm totally wrong about this.

#### Can the app show the upcoming event in the menu bar?

I don't plan to add this. You can get this feature in my [Dato app](/dato) (with a lot of customizability).

#### Can you add a button to quickly join a video call?

I don't plan to add this. You can get this feature in my [Dato app](/dato).

#### Can you add a menu bar icon with a date inside?

I don't have any immediate plans to add this, but I will consider it if I get a lot of requests for it. You can get this feature in my [Dato app](/dato).

#### Can you add more menu bar icons?

I'm happy to consider requests. You can find icons [here](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/).

#### I added a calendar to the Calendar app but it doesn't show up in the app

You need to enable the calendar in the app settings.

#### Can you add support for Google Calendar / Outlook 365 / Exchange?

It's already supported. Just add your calendars to the built-in Calendar app and then enable those calendars in the app settings.

#### My Google Calendar does not update in the app

You might have to re-authenticate your Google account. Open the Calendar app's settings, go to the “Accounts” pane, and try to remove and re-add the Google account.

#### How can I export, import, sync, or backup the settings?

[See this guide.](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/main/backup-app-settings.md)

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

I don't have any immediate plans to localize the app.

#### Where can I find the changelog?
